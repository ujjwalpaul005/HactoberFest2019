Contribute to this year's Hacktoberfest!

!!! Due to breaking the rules of Hacktoberfest (high quality pull requests), I need to notify you all that pull requests created in this repository will not count into your 4 pull requests. However, making your first contribution here is still the best way how to make your first contribution. Thanks.

## What and how to start?

All you need to do is to submit a pull request with your name and some small greeting for other people here :-D.

### Okay, but WTF is a pull request?

Pull request is a request to add your code (or text in this repo) to the original repository. By doing 5 pull requests you can get a limited Hacktoberfest t-shirt! And the main thing, you can help other people with bugs and implement features.

If you don't know how to do a pull request you can use the official guide by GitHub available on this [link](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request). If you have any problems, don't be shy and click that issues button on the top. There you can ask and we will be glad to help you.

## Okay, but what do I need to do?

Make a fork of this repo and add your name and greeting to the following "Names" section. Then submit a pull request and you are all done!
Don't want to submit your name? Feel free to visit the issue section and choose one of the topics.

## Rules

Please submit only one pull request at the time and don't spam. Please wait until your pull request is reviewed, it can take some time.
Don't use dirty words and be welcome for beginners and other people in this community.

## Say hello!
